    "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about Viecom AI",
    "q1": {
      "question": "How does the credit system work?",
      "answer": "Credits are used for AI generations. Image generation costs 5-30 credits depending on the model (e.g., Nano Banana 5 credits, Nano Banana Pro 30 credits). Videos cost 15-130 credits depending on model and resolution. Free users get 15 signup credits. Pro plans include 500-900 monthly credits. You can also purchase credit packs starting at $9.90 for 200 credits."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "What's included in the Free plan?",
      "answer": "Free users get 15 credits on signup, daily check-in rewards (2 credits/day), referral rewards (10 credits), and social share rewards (2 credits). You can generate images and videos using these credits, with batch generation support (1 concurrent) and 7-day asset display."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "What video models and resolutions are available?",
      "answer": "We offer Sora 2 (720p only, 15-20 credits) and Sora 2 Pro (720p/1080p, 45-130 credits) for 10s or 15s videos. Sora 2 Pro delivers higher quality with faster generation times. All plans can access both models using credits."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can I use generated content commercially?",
      "answer": "Yes! Pro and Pro+ subscribers receive a full commercial license for all generated images and videos. You can use them for advertising, social media, e-commerce listings, and any commercial purpose without attribution."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "How does batch generation work?",
      "answer": "Upload multiple images or prompts to generate content in batches. Free users can process 1 concurrent task, Pro users get 3 concurrent tasks, and Pro+ users get 10. Our smart queue prioritizes 720p tasks for faster feedback on mixed batches."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "What is brand analysis and how does it help?",
      "answer": "Our AI analyzes your website or uploaded assets to extract your brand's color palette, tone, and style. This ensures all generated content maintains 100% brand consistency across images and videos, saving you hours of manual editing."
    },
    "q7": {
      "question": "Can I upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime?",
      "answer": "Yes! You can upgrade immediately (prorated billing), downgrade at next billing cycle, or cancel anytime. Downgrades take effect at renewal to preserve your current period benefits. Credits roll over within the same plan tier."
    },
    "q8": {
      "question": "What image generation models are available?",
      "answer": "We offer multiple AI models: Nano Banana (5 credits) for standard quality, and Nano Banana Pro (30 credits) for premium quality with enhanced detail and realism. Nano Banana Pro delivers superior results for professional e-commerce content with better brand consistency and higher resolution output."
    },
    "q9": {
      "question": "What happens when I run out of credits?",
      "answer": "You have several options: (1) Purchase one-time credit packs starting at $9.90 for 200 credits (packs never expire), (2) Upgrade to Pro/Pro+ for monthly credit allocations (500-900 credits/month), or (3) Earn credits daily through check-ins (2 credits/day), referrals (10 credits per referral), and social sharing (2 credits per share). Credit packs are perfect if you need extra credits without committing to a subscription."
